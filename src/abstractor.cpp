/** 
 * The project aims to process a list of files in a multi-threaded program.
 * The program reads the number of threads, abstract file list, query words 
 * and number of requested results parameters from the input file.
 * It puts the abstract file list into a FIFO queue, initializes a vector
 * for results and protects both of them with mutexes. Seperate threads
 * are created and these data structures are passed to them. Using read/write
 * mutex structures, each thread takes an abstract from the queue, process it
 * find the jaccard score, and return the result. Best results from each thread
 * is written to a global result vector when the thread finishes its job.
 * Finally when all threads are done, main thread writes the best results
 * to the output file.
